<!-- Thanks for the interest in Spring Cloud Data Flow! Before you create a new issue, please answer the following question.-->

**Is this a "Bug Report" or "Feature Request"?** (choose one and remove the irrelevant sections before submitting the issue):

<!--
If this is a "Bug Report", please:

Describe:
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Additionally, it'd help if you can include the logs and entire stacktrace including the "caused by". (see GitHub-Markdown docs at: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown for logs/code formatting guidelines)_

Release versions:
There's an API (http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#api-guide-resources-server-meta-retrieving) to gather SCDF's system information including the dependent projects and the associated versions. Alternatively, you can capture this information from the Dashboard's About tab (http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#dashboard), so make sure to include the copied JSON in the bug report.

Custom Apps:
If your Stream or Task data pipeline includes custom apps and there's a problem associated with it, it'd be good to review the sample-app (add a link to GitHub repo) and the release versions in use. Make sure to also share the register, create, and deploy/launch DSL commands for completeness.

To Reproduce:
Include the steps to reproduce the behavior. Better yet, if you have a reproducible sample, please attach it in the issue. It'd help us to relate to the problem more easily. 

creenshots:
Where applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
